<h1 style="padding-left:70px;"> Education and Health for Women's Empowerment</h1>
    <p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;">Various studies, as well as our experience, have shown that when we work towards women empowerment, the whole society
    benefits. But unfortunately in India, far from empowering women, most are denied even their basic rights like health,
    education of girls for women empowerment, employment and a respectable status in society.
    
    According to a recent UNDP Human Development Report, India has a dangerously imbalanced sex ratio, the chief reason
    being rampant female infanticide and sex-selective abortions.
    
    Swabhiman, meaning self-respect in English, was initiated in 2005 to address these challenges through a simple yet
    effective approach. The programme is specifically aimed at realization of both individual and collective self-esteem and
    inner strength for marginalised and socially excluded women and adolescent girls through innovative community practices.
    
    A tailor-made strategy called the '4 S Model' has been developed under Swabhiman, the women empowerment programme. The
    ‘4 S Model’ is an acronym for four novel approaches, namely Seeking Healthcare as a Behaviour, Support for Education,
    Supporters through Male Involvement, and Sustaining the Change in Communities.
    
    The programme identifies adolescent girls and women from the community and develops them into Change Agents, who in turn
    actively contribute to the community mobilization process.
    
    So far, Swabhiman through women's education empowerment program and health programmes has successfully made a difference
    to the lives of over 560,000 women and girl children.</p>
