<h1 style="padding-left:70px;">Disaster Response</h1>
    <p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;">Being a disaster-prone country, India is highly vulnerable to various types of natural calamities due to its
    geographical positioning. According to the National Disaster Management Authority, Govt. of India, more than 58.6% of
    the country's landmass is prone to earthquakes and over 12% is prone to floods; close to 5,700kms out of the 7,516kms
    long coastline is prone to cyclones and tsunamis; while 68% of its cultivable area is prone to droughts which is why
    disaster preparedness is of outmost importance.
    
    Disaster risks in India are further compounded by increasing vulnerabilities related to changing demographics,
    socio-economic conditions- unplanned urbanization, development within high-risk zones, environmental degradation,
    climate change, and epidemics and pandemics. All these factors have created a situation where disasters seriously
    threaten the sustainable development of the country, besides innumerable lives and livelihoods.
    
    Smile Foundation, with its welfare interventions focused on children and their families, responds to the call of
    humanity in times of such calamities under its Disaster Response programme through emergency relief programs. From the
    Kashmir earthquake in 2005 to the Uttarakhand floods in 2013, Smile Foundation has acted promptly to reach out and
    respond to the immediate needs of the disaster affected people, while also maintaining a sustainable approach to help
    them rebuild their lives by facilitating their education, healthcare and livelihood.
    
    Some of the calamities during which Smile Foundation has initiated crisis management during disaster are the Tsunami,
    the Kashmir Earthquake, the Maharashtra floods, the Bihar floods and the Uttarakhand floods.</p>

                    <p>In the late-end of July, 2018, severe flooding affected the Indian state of Kerala due to sudden

                        century. Nearly, 400 people died within half a month, while at least 4.5 lakh people were
