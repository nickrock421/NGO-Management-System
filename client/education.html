    <h1 style="padding-left:70px;"> Mission Eduaction</h1>

    <p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:50px;">Mission Education is a national level programme of Peppy Happy Foundation, an NGO for education which is committed to
    providing basic education and healthcare to underprivileged children. Peppy Happy Foundation, an NGO for poor child education
    believes that whether you are addressing healthcare, poverty, population control, unemployment or human rights, there's
    no better place to start than in the corridors of education.
    
    Education is both the means as well as the end to a better life; means, because it empowers an individual to earn
    his/her livelihood and the end because it increases one's awareness on a range of issues â€“ from healthcare to
    appropriate social behavior to understanding one's rights, and in the process evolve as a better citizen.
    Peppy Happy Foundation's educational initiatives include Pre-school [3-6 yrs], Non Formal Education [6-14 yrs non-school
    going], Remedial Education [6-14 yrs school going] and Bridge Course [14-18 yrs drop-outs]. It is an education NGOM
    which works for education for underprivileged children who are under difficult circumstances, such as child labour,
    children of poorest of the parents, children inflicted and affected with HIV/AIDS, street and runaway children, children
    with rare disabilities, disaster struck children and slum children. Special emphasis is given on girl education and
    women education, so that they and their families get empowered.
    
    Since its inception in 2002, more than 232,000 underprivileged children have directly benefitted from the Mission
    Education programme</p>
